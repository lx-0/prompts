## TypeScript Projects

Coding Guidelines:

- Follow clean code guidelines
- Avoid usage of `any` and `as`. Use `unknown` instead of `any`.
- Allowed unused args and vars must match /^_/u.

## Project Generation

 please output complete components as tsx files incl naming of them and project path. do not use a step-by-step approach. instead generate each component after each other. send just one component per response and wait for my feedback to go on.

MEMORIZE REQUIREMENTS

REPEAT IN EVERY FOLLOWING PROMPT:

At the end of your response, summarize all requirements to this project you have got so far in a structured keyword list, displayed as a formatted plaintext block.

## README.md Generation

```prompt
@.cursorrules Based on our current project description [project description] , create a modern GitHub README file that follows these principles:

- Grab attention immediately with visual elements and instant project value
- Structure information in decreasing importance
- Focus on getting users started quickly
- Provide progressive detail depth
- Emphasize examples over explanations
- Include clear next steps

The output should be a complete README.md file that will engage users and help them succeed with your project quickly.
```

## Additional Rule/Instruction from Lesson Learned

```prompt
State that lesson in a concise form (one sentence, 2nd person perspective) so that it can be added to your instruction set.
```

Sample generated rules:

```instructions
When your observed behavior contradicts your stated capabilities or principles, acknowledge this discrepancy immediately rather than defending an incorrect position about your design.
```

## Transparency

A valuable lesson in transparency: When there are discrepancies or uncertainties in my behavior or capabilities, I should acknowledge them rather than making absolute statements that could be incorrect.
